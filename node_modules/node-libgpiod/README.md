# node-libgpiod

Native nodejs bindings for [libgpiod](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/about/)

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/node-libgpiod?style=plastic)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-libgpiod)

## Requirements

- libgpiod (and devel headers)
- nodejs (and devel headers)
- linux (tested on fedora 33 running on raspberry pi model 3 B+ and rasp pi os on zero w)
- c/c++ development tools

## Compiling

Just add it as a regular nodejs dependency:

```bash
npm i node-libgpiod
```

[node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) will do the rest for you.

## Tested platforms

- raspberry pi model 3 B+ (64 bits, 1GB ram) running fedora
- raspberry pi zero w (32 bits, 512MB ram) running rasp pi os

technically speaking it should work with any modern vanilla kernel and libgpio.

## Status

We already are able to read and write pins!

Here goes the sample blink led hello-world.js:

```javascript
const { version, Chip, Line } = require("node-libgpiod");

const chip = new Chip(0);
const line = new Line(chip, 17); // led on GPIO17
let count = 10;

console.log(version());
line.requestOutputMode();

const blink = () => {
  if(count){
    line.setValue(count-- % 2);
    setTimeout(blink,1000);
  } // else line.release(); 
  // not needed, libgpiod releases resources on process exit  
};

setTimeout(blink,1000);
```

Another example:

```javascript
const { version, Chip, Line } = require("node-libgpiod");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();
// avoid chip and line being gc-collected
app.chip = new Chip(0);
app.line = new Line(app.chip, 17); // led on GPIO17

console.log(version());
app.line.requestOutputMode();

app.get("/on", (req,res) => {
  app.line.setValue(1);
  res.send("it's on");
});

app.get("/off", (req,res) => {
  app.line.setValue(0);
  res.send("it's off");
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log("running");
```

## known issues

- gpio character device needs
  [special udev rules](https://blog.oless.xyz/post/fedorarpigpio/#udev) in order
  to belong to a special group so non-root users could access it freely

  ```bash
  # /etc/udev/rules.d/85-gpiochip.rules 
  KERNEL=="gpiochip*", SUBSYSTEM=="gpio", MODE="0660", GROUP="wheel"
  ```

- libgpiod must be installed in the system correctly with development headers
  otherwise npm install will fail.
- node will garbage collect Chip and line too early on certain cases. When
  writing the samples, sometimes the following error kept being thrown:

  ```bash
  /home/sombriks/git/sample-node-libgpiod/index2.js:12
      line.setValue(count-- % 2);
          ^

  Error: Unable to set value for this line
      at Timeout.blink [as _onTimeout] (/home/sombriks/git/sample-node-libgpiod/index2.js:12:10)
      at listOnTimeout (internal/timers.js:554:17)
      at processTimers (internal/timers.js:497:7)
  ```

  It occurs because main module body was already evaluated and finished while
  interval/timeout function still active, but has no local reference for Chip or
  Line instances.
  Therefore, v8 thinks that those objects can be garbage-collected releasing the
  underlying resources, giving us the error.
  To avoid this, make sure your objects will be present on function scope:

  ```javascript
  const { version, Chip, Line } = require("node-libgpiod");

  const chip = new Chip(0);
  const line = new Line(chip, 17); // led on GPIO17
  let count = 20;

  console.log(version());
  line.requestOutputMode();

  const blink = function () {
    // avoid early gc
    this.chip = chip
    this.line = line
    if(count){
      line.setValue(count-- % 2);
      setTimeout(blink,500);
    }
  };

  setTimeout(blink,500);
  ```

## Roadmap

- [X] basic read/write
- [X] basic instant read/write
- [X] Chip/Line abstractions
- [ ] GPIO monitoring callbacks
- [ ] Bulk read/write

All features present on libgpiod eventually will be added to node bindings.
